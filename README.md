# Skyline CRS

**Skyline CRS** is a scalable computer reservation system (CRS) for a fictional airline called Skyline, built for the cloud. The project is deployed using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers and also provides a basic [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) configuration.

The system exposes a public REST API and uses JWT token based authentication, hence allowing integration with other travel agencies.
There is also a web application for the airline, from which the clients may make all actions.
